Predict classification of products that increase gross profit margin using KNN in R

Anna's World Inc. wants to predict what products will increase their gross profit margin along with purchase of fuel. 

CONCLSUION:
Overall, our model does a great job at predicting when a purchase will be high profit margin versus low profit margin and gets it right 83% of the time. The aspect of the model that is the least effective is its sensitivity and the aspect that is the most effective is the specificity. This means that the models is very good at classifying the low margin purchases successfully (specificity), but slightly worse at classifying the high margin purchases correctly (sensitivity). Thus, while the model is quite good overall, it particularly excels at identifying bad transactions.
